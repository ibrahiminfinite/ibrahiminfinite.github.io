An engineer passionate about robotics and its applications to space exploration.

At the moment I am working on a re-implementation of MoveIt Servo, as part of Google Summer of Code 2023 with [MoveIt](https://moveit.picknik.ai/main/index.html). 

I enjoy working on robotics across the stack, while I understand and have worked with hardware, most of my work in the past couple of years has been software focused. Frequent enocunters with simulators have caused me to develop an interest in simulations and so I am actively working towards specializing in Modelling and Simulation.

I have previously worked with fast paced multi-diciplinary teams to develop robotic manipulators for various HMI panel testing rquirements for organizations like BOSCH. Recent works involved development and maintaince of simulation stack and simulation assets for developing control strategies for a quadrupedal robot. 

When I am not working I enjoy motorcycle rides to the mountains, there is something about the twisty and misty roads of the mountains that call to you.
